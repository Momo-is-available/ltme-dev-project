Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account and project

Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ltme-dev-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

   Get these values from: https://app.supabase.com → Your Project → Settings → API

4. Set up the database

   Run the SQL commands in `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Create a new query
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Run the query

   This will create all necessary tables, RLS policies, functions, and indexes.

5. Set up storage buckets

   Run the SQL commands in `supabase-storage-avatars.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Create a new query
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-storage-avatars.sql`
   - Run the query

   This will create the storage buckets for photos, audio, and avatars.

6. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
